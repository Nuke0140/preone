Task ID: 0-init
Agent: Main (Super Z)
Task: Read ADR-111 DevOps Infrastructure + Backend Technical Design v1.0 → create full project structure + plan backend step-by-step.

Work Log:
- Extracted both .docx files via python-docx → saved to /home/z/my-project/extracted/
- Read ADR-111 DevOps Infrastructure v1.0 (19 chapters, 23 tables) — covers Docker, K8s, CI/CD, NGINX, PG HA (Patroni), Redis Sentinel, monitoring (Prometheus + Grafana), logging (Loki + Promtail), backup (Velero + pgBackRest), DR (multi-region), security, scalability
- Read Backend Technical Design v1.0 (29 chapters, 41 tables) — covers tech stack (NestJS 11 + Prisma 6 + PG 16 + Redis 7.2 + BullMQ 5), layered architecture (Presentation/Application/Domain/Infrastructure), module structure, dependency rules, CQRS, domain events, BullMQ queues, cache layers, transaction patterns, validation, exception handling, security, multi-tenant strategy (RLS), logging, observability, testing, performance, coding standards
- Created full monorepo structure under /home/z/my-project/preone/ — apps/{api,web,mobile,worker} + packages/{database,shared,ui,config,types} + infra/{docker,k8s,terraform,helm} + scripts + docs
- Created root package.json + pnpm-workspace.yaml + turbo.json + .gitignore + .prettierrc.json + README.md
- Created @preone/api package: NestJS 11 + TypeScript 5.6 strict + tsconfig with path aliases (@app, @common, @config, @infra, @shared, @modules)
- Created 14 business module scaffolds (identity, crm, admissions, student, academics, attendance, communication, finance, inventory, hr, administration, reports, settings, platform) — each with DDD layer folders (controllers, application/{commands,queries,handlers,dto,mappers,services}, domain/{aggregates,entities,value-objects,repositories,services,events,policies,specifications}, infrastructure/{prisma,repositories,cache,events,jobs}, presentation)
- Built DDD kernel: AggregateRoot, Entity, ValueObject, DomainEvent, Result<T,E>, IRepository, Paginated, PaginationParams
- Built AppException hierarchy (10 exception types) + ResponseDto envelope
- Built AllExceptionsFilter (global error handler with traceId correlation + Prisma + Zod error mapping)
- Built TraceIdMiddleware (W3C traceparent), HttpLoggingInterceptor, TimeoutInterceptor, TraceContextInterceptor (AsyncLocalStorage)
- Built JwtAuthGuard (RS256 verify, populates req.user), PermissionsGuard (Redis cache, versioned keys), @Public @Permissions @ReqUser decorators
- Built PrismaService with withTenant() RLS context (SET LOCAL app.school_id, app.user_id, app.branch_id) + asPlatformAdmin() (BYPASSRLS)
- Built RedisService with 10 logical DBs (cache, session, rate-limit, OTP, BullMQ, locks, pubsub, feature-flags, idempotency, geo)
- Built CacheService with versioned cache keys + read-through helper + pub/sub broadcast
- Built S3Service with pre-signed upload/download URLs
- Built EventBusService (in-process for v1; v1.1 will add Redis Stream outbox)
- Built HealthController (/health/live, /health/ready, /health)
- Built OpenTelemetry startup (auto-instrumentation for HTTP, PG, Redis, BullMQ)
- Built env config (Zod-validated AppConfig with 11 namespaces)
- Built Docker Compose for local dev (PG 16 + Redis 7.2 + MinIO + MailHog + LocalStack)
- Built PostgreSQL init.sql (extensions: uuid-ossp, pgcrypto, pg_trgm, unaccent, vector, btree_gist; platform_admin role; preone_app role; uuid_v7 function; set_updated_at trigger; soft_delete_handler trigger; audit.audit_log table; connection settings)
- Built Prisma schema foundation (14 models): School, Branch, User, Role, Permission, RolePermission, UserRole, Session, RefreshToken, OtpChallenge, AuditLog, FeatureFlag, SchoolSubscription, PlatformBilling, PlatformIntegration, Classroom
- Built Identity module: AuthController + AuthService + JwtService + OtpService + 3 stub controllers (Schools, Users, Roles, Permissions) + SchoolAggregate + UserAggregate + RoleAggregate + PrismaSchoolRepository + PrismaUserRepository + PrismaRoleRepository
- Created PROJECT_STRUCTURE.md with full roadmap (10 waves, ~24 weeks, 307-table schema target)

Stage Summary:
- Documents fully read: ADR-111 DevOps v1.0 + Backend TD v1.0
- Monorepo scaffolded at /home/z/my-project/preone/ (~50 directories, 30+ files)
- Foundation code complete: bootstrap, DI wiring, DDD kernel, exception handling, auth guards, infra modules (Prisma, Redis, S3, Cache, EventBus, Health, OTel)
- Prisma schema foundation: 14 models covering Identity + Platform Management domains
- Docker Compose for local dev ready to `docker compose up -d`
- Identity module scaffolded with auth flow end-to-end (login + OTP + refresh + logout)
- Next steps: add vitest, run prisma migrate, build out SchoolService.createSchool() end-to-end, then proceed to Wave 2 (Identity module APIs) → Wave 3 (Student + Academics) → Wave 4 (Admissions + CRM) → Wave 5 (Attendance + Communication) → Wave 6 (Finance) → Wave 7 (Inventory + HR + Admin + Transport) → Wave 8 (Reports + Settings + Platform) → Wave 9 (Hardening) → Wave 10 (Deployment)

- /home/z/my-project/preone/ (full monorepo)
- /home/z/my-project/preone/PROJECT_STRUCTURE.md (implementation roadmap)
- /home/z/my-project/preone/apps/api/ (NestJS backend with 14 module scaffolds)
- /home/z/my-project/preone/packages/database/prisma/schema.prisma (14 models, will grow to 307)
- /home/z/my-project/preone/infra/docker/ (local dev stack)
- /home/z/my-project/preone/extracted/ (parsed docx contents for reference)
